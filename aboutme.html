  <h3>Robotics and Thoughts</h3>
  <p>Manuela Veloso's and Ayanna Howard's work allow computer scientists to learn more about how robots interact with humans and obstacles.
  <br>Their work shows how robots are actually simple creatures and they need to be taught how to avoid rocks on Mars and interact with a ball. 
  <br>Our team put the circuits together while another person wrote the code and she helped explain it to us. Another way our teamwork could
  <br>have improved is by maybe working on the code together instead of having one of my teammates write the code. The basic pieces are
  <br>beginning the code with the variables being defined and loops to make sure that the light patterns would continue to repeat </p>
